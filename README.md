Sketch Archivist

—

A project to learn sketch plugin scripting.

—

With a keystroke, arrange all artboards not edited today into a page called 'Archive'.

Artboards moved into 'Archive' will be arraged from left to right, from oldest (leftmost) to newest (rightmost).

If multiple artboards were created in a single day, they will create a column of artboards.

In this way, old work can be made easily navigable.
